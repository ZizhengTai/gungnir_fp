Gungnir is a library that provides abstractions for functional programming in C++. It is made with efficiency, ease of use, and full compatibility with the C++11 standard in mind.

([Gungnir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gungnir) is Odin's magic spear that always hits its mark. This library is named after the spear, in the hope of having the same power and reliability.)
